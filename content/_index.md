Welcome to gebt1000's hardstyle and anime blog! Thank you for wanting to read my yapping. Here I, gebt1000, will write about two of my favourite things in the world, hardstyle and anime.

For hardstyle, I will write about my thoughts on a specific track, but sometimes I might write about an album or a set. I may also deviate to other hard dance genres, such as hardcore and frenchcore. I usually like euphoric stuff more, but I also love raw tracks. Some of my favourite artists are Phuture Noize and B-Front.

For anime, I will write about my thoughts on a series or one of the seasons of the series. I generally likes CGDCT, slice of life, and comedy more than other genres.
