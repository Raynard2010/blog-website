Hello and welcome to my first real article in my blog. The very first track I’m going to give my thoughts on is actually going to be a remix. A remix by Galactixx on NSCLT’s Dances Of The Soul. It’s a remix from 2019 but I think I discovered it in 2020.  This remix is my first exposure to NSCLT and this is one of the first few tracks I knew from Galactixx. I don’t really remember how I discovered this remix (it’s kind of vague but I think I discovered it from a compilation YouTube video) but I’m very sure that I fell in love with it on first listen.

In my opinion, the melody is one of the most beautiful hardstyle melodies ever. It might be my favourite melody from Galactixx as well. I discovered this remix before the original so I can’t really compare it with the original. I’m also so used to this remix that listening to the original feels wrong to me. It feels off.

The main highlight of this track is absolutely the melodic drops. Like most tracks from around 2019, the track begins with a nice mid-intro. After the mid-intro, there’s the speech vocal, followed by a great melody in the break, to prepare you for the absolute slammer which is the melodic drop. The second drop then hits in with that amazing and **crunchy** kicks, together with the beautiful melody and lead sound. Combined, it hits you with a sound that can ascend you to heaven. Same thing with the third drop which is pretty similar to the second drop.

Me when I listen to this track:

What a beautiful track…
