Hello and welcome back to another hardstyle blog. This time I'm reviewing one of my favourite Noisecontrollers tracks ever, Dying For A Light. I still remember the first time this track got teased on Noisecontrollers' Instagram. I instantly fell in love with it even though the teaser didn't reveal much at all. I knew right away that it's going to be a banger and heck I was right. Noisecontrollers got to play it at the last Qlimax ever in 2024 and I was mind blown by it. It then got released a few weeks later and it instantly got into my top 10 of 2024.

First drop got me like:

The track begins with a banging kick right away. It's so catchy and so good even though it contradicts with the vibe of the rest of the track. The vocal in the first drop is alright I guess. In my opinion, it's not that important.

The track then continues with a great female vocal with a incredibly meaningful and emotional lyric. It's easily relatable and I love it for that. After that, the break comes in with an insanely beautiful melody. It builds up the vibe slowly but beautifully. The sound design of the lead is also really good.

Second drop got me like:

Next, the first melodic drop comes. I saw some people commenting about how the kicks are too weak. I can agree but at the same time I love it. Then, one of my favorite things in hardstyle, which is *vocal on kicks*, comes in. I don't know why but I really love it when producers put vocal on kicks. 

Third drop got me like:

It's now time for another break and then the third drop. In my opinion, the first melody is much better, but the melody here is also good. This melody is the kind of melody that can bring you up to heaven. The kicks here also sound good.

As a cherry on the top, this track is almost 6 minutes long which is very rare, especially when it's technically not the extended mix and it's 2024. Really good length for an emotional track like this as it allows you to immerse into the track.

I'm dying for a light...
