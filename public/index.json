Here I, gebt1000, will write about two of my favourite things in the world, hardstyle and anime.\nFor hardstyle, I will write about my thoughts on a specific track, but sometimes I might write about an album or a set. I may also deviate to other hard dance genres, such as hardcore and frenchcore. I usually like euphoric stuff more, but I also love raw tracks. Some of my favourite artists are Phuture Noize and B-Front.\nFor anime, I will write about my thoughts on a series or one of the seasons of the series. I generally likes CGDCT, slice of life, and comedy more than other genres.\n","date":"16 February 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"","summary":"","title":"","type":"page"},{"content":"","date":"16 February 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"All Tags (both hardstyle and anime tags)","summary":"","title":"All Tags (both hardstyle and anime tags)","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"16 February 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/hardstyle/","section":"All Tags (both hardstyle and anime tags)","summary":"","title":"Hardstyle","type":"tags"},{"content":"View all tags\n","date":"16 February 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/hardstyle/","section":"Hardstyle blogs","summary":"","title":"Hardstyle blogs","type":"hardstyle"},{"content":"","date":"16 February 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/noisecontrollers/","section":"All Tags (both hardstyle and anime tags)","summary":"","title":"Noisecontrollers","type":"tags"},{"content":"\rHello and welcome back to another hardstyle blog. This time I\u0026rsquo;m reviewing one of my favourite Noisecontrollers tracks ever, Dying For A Light. I still remember the first time this track got teased on Noisecontrollers\u0026rsquo; Instagram. I instantly fell in love with it even though the teaser didn\u0026rsquo;t reveal much at all. I knew right away that it\u0026rsquo;s going to be a banger and heck I was right. Noisecontrollers got to play it at the last Qlimax ever in 2024 and I was mind blown by it. It then got released a few weeks later and it instantly got into my top 10 of 2024.\nFirst drop got me like: The track begins with a banging kick right away. It\u0026rsquo;s so catchy and so good even though it contradicts with the vibe of the rest of the track. The vocal in the first drop is alright I guess. In my opinion, it\u0026rsquo;s not that important.\nThe track then continues with a great female vocal with a incredibly meaningful and emotional lyric. It\u0026rsquo;s easily relatable and I love it for that. After that, the break comes in with an insanely beautiful melody. It builds up the vibe slowly but beautifully. The sound design of the lead is also really good.\nSecond drop got me like: Next, the first melodic drop comes. I saw some people commenting about how the kicks are too weak. I can agree but at the same time I love it. Then, one of my favorite things in hardstyle, which is vocal on kicks, comes in. I don\u0026rsquo;t know why but I really love it when producers put vocal on kicks.\nThird drop got me like: Me going to heaven\rIt\u0026rsquo;s now time for another break and then the third drop. In my opinion, the first melody is much better, but the melody here is also good. This melody is the kind of melody that can bring you up to heaven. The kicks here also sound good.\nAs a cherry on the top, this track is almost 6 minutes long which is very rare, especially when it\u0026rsquo;s technically not the extended mix and it\u0026rsquo;s 2024. Really good length for an emotional track like this as it allows you to immerse into the track.\nI\u0026rsquo;m dying for a light\u0026hellip;\n","date":"16 February 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/hardstyle/dying-for-a-light/","section":"Hardstyle blogs","summary":"","title":"Noisecontrollers -  Dying For A Light Review","type":"hardstyle"},{"content":"View all tags\n","date":"26 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/anime/","section":"Anime blogs","summary":"","title":"Anime blogs","type":"anime"},{"content":"","date":"26 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/cgdct/","section":"All Tags (both hardstyle and anime tags)","summary":"","title":"CGDCT","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"26 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/comedy/","section":"All Tags (both hardstyle and anime tags)","summary":"","title":"Comedy","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"26 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/galactixx/","section":"All Tags (both hardstyle and anime tags)","summary":"","title":"Galactixx","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"26 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/iyashikei/","section":"All Tags (both hardstyle and anime tags)","summary":"","title":"Iyashikei","type":"tags"},{"content":"This is just a test article for now\n","date":"26 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/anime/non-non-biyori/","section":"Anime blogs","summary":"","title":"Non Non Biyori Review","type":"anime"},{"content":"","date":"26 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/nsclt/","section":"All Tags (both hardstyle and anime tags)","summary":"","title":"NSCLT","type":"tags"},{"content":"\rHello and welcome to my first real article in my blog. The very first track I’m going to give my thoughts on is actually going to be a remix. A remix by Galactixx of NSCLT’s Dances Of The Soul. It’s a remix from 2019 but I discovered it in 2020. I don’t really remember how I discovered this remix (it’s kind of vague but I think I discovered it from a compilation YouTube video) but I’m very sure that I fell in love with it on first listen. This remix is my first exposure to NSCLT and this is one of the first few tracks I knew from Galactixx.\nIn my opinion, the melody is one of the most beautiful hardstyle melodies ever. It might be my favourite melody from Galactixx as well. I discovered this remix before the original so I can’t really compare it with the original. I’m also so used to this remix that listening to the original feels wrong to me. It feels off.\nThe main highlight of this track is absolutely the melodic drops. Like most tracks from around 2019, the track begins with a nice mid-intro. After the mid-intro, there’s the speech vocal, followed by a great melody in the break, to prepare you for the absolute slammer which is the melodic drop. The second drop then hits in with that amazing and crunchy kicks, together with the beautiful melody and lead sound. Combined, it hits you with a sound that can ascend you to heaven. Same thing with the third drop which is pretty similar to the second drop.\nMe when I listen to this track: You\u0026rsquo;re gonna see me use this image very often\rWhat a beautiful track…\n","date":"26 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/hardstyle/dances-of-the-soul-remix/","section":"Hardstyle blogs","summary":"","title":"NSCLT -  Dances Of The Soul (Galactixx Remix) Review","type":"hardstyle"},{"content":"","date":"26 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/slice-of-life/","section":"All Tags (both hardstyle and anime tags)","summary":"","title":"Slice of Life","type":"tags"},{"content":"\rNotes: This is just a test article but one day I\u0026rsquo;ll actually review this track\nHello there.
